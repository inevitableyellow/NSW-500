# Learning Objectives

-   Understand the relationship between reported effective collaboration and remote work
-   Explore the relationship between leadership, team culture, and the effectiveness of collaboration
-   Gain insight into the desires of the average employee, by industry

## Package Installations

```{r cars}
sdata <- read.csv("2021_rws.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
